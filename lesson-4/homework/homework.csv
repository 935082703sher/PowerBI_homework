1. Merge vs Append
Merge: Combines columns from two queries based on a common key (like SQL JOIN). You choose join type (Inner, Left Outer, etc.).

Append: Stacks rows from two or more queries with identical or compatible column structures (like UNION in SQL).

2. Split Full Name into First and Last Name
Select the Full Name column.

Use Home > Split Column > By Delimiter.

Choose space ( ) as the delimiter.

Result: Two columns (e.g., Full Name.1 as First Name, Full Name.2 as Last Name).

3. Pivot Columns Use
Converts row values in a column into column headers.

Common use: turn transactions into a summary table (e.g., Products as columns, quantities as values).

4. Undo a Step
Go to Applied Steps in the Query Settings pane.

Right-click the step to remove it or use the X icon to delete it.

5. Reference vs Duplicate
Duplicate: Creates a copy of the entire query and its current results.

Reference: Creates a new query based on the output of an existing query—linked dynamically.

6. Merge Orders.csv and Customers.xlsx on CustID (Inner Join)
Load both files.

Use Home > Merge Queries.

Select CustID in both.

Choose Join Kind: Inner.

Expand fields from the Customers table as needed.

7. Pivot Product Column to Show Total Quantity per Product
Select the Product column.

Go to Transform > Pivot Column.

Set Values Column to Quantity.

Use Sum as aggregation.

8. Append Orders_Jan.csv + Orders_Feb.csv
Load both queries.

Go to Home > Append Queries.

Choose Two Tables, select Orders_Jan and Orders_Feb.

Confirm to create a combined table.

9. Use Fill Down to Replace Nulls in Email Column
Select Email column.

Go to Transform > Fill > Down.

This fills each null with the previous non-null value.

10. Extract Domain from Email
Use Add Column > Extract > Text After Delimiter.

Delimiter: @.

Or use this custom column formula:

m
Копировать
Редактировать
Text.AfterDelimiter([Email], "@")
11. M Code: Merge Dynamically Based on JoinType Parameter
Assuming JoinType is a text parameter:

m
Копировать
Редактировать
let
    Orders = ...,
    Customers = ...,
    JoinType = "Inner",  // Can be changed to "LeftOuter", etc.
    JoinFunction = Record.ToFunction(Record.Field(Table.JoinKinds, JoinType)),
    Merged = Table.NestedJoin(Orders, {"CustID"}, Customers, {"CustID"}, "NewTable", JoinFunction)
in
    Merged
12. Unpivot Columns like Jan_Sales, Feb_Sales to Month/Sales
Select the sales columns (e.g., Jan_Sales, Feb_Sales).

Go to Transform > Unpivot Columns.

Rename Attribute to Month, Value to Sales.
