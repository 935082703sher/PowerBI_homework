1. What is a Primary Key in a Table?
A primary key is a column (or combination of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
âž¡ In Power BI, it's typically used in dimension tables to link to fact tables.

2. Two Types of Table Relationships in Power BI

One-to-many (1:*): Most common, e.g., one Customer â†’ many Sales.


Many-to-many (:): Used when neither table has unique values for join columns.


3. How to Create a Relationship Between Two Tables

Go to Model view.


Drag the column (e.g., CustomerID) from one table to the matching column in the other.


Set the cardinality and cross-filter direction.


4. What is a Star Schema?
A star schema is a data model with:

A central fact table (e.g., Sales),


Connected to multiple dimension tables (e.g., Customers, Products, Dates),


Shaped like a star ðŸŒŸ.


5. Which Table is Typically the Fact Table in a Sales Dataset?
âœ… Sales is the fact table â€” it holds transactions (quantities, revenue, etc.).

6. Link Sales.csv to Customers.csv using CustomerID (One-to-Many)

Make sure:


CustomerID in Customers is unique â†’ one side.


CustomerID in Sales has duplicates â†’ many side.


Create a relationship:
Customers[CustomerID] â†’ Sales[CustomerID]
(One-to-Many, Single Direction).


7. Why is ProductID in Sales.csv a Foreign Key?
Because it references the ProductID in the Products table, linking each sale to product details.
âž¡ It's a foreign key in Sales pointing to the primary key in Products.
9. Why Star Schema Improves Performance

Relationships are simple (1:*), enabling efficient DAX calculations.


Minimizes joins, keeping the model clear and fast.


Encourages reusability of dimensions and consistent filtering.

11. Optimize a Model with Circular Relationships
Circular relationships cause ambiguity.
âœ… Fixes:

Break the loop by removing unnecessary relationships.


Replace physical relationships with DAX using TREATAS(), LOOKUPVALUE(), or measures instead of columns.


Consider adding a bridge table.


12. Create Role-Playing Dimension for OrderDate and ShipDate

Load the Date table once.


Duplicate it (right-click â†’ Duplicate) for each role (e.g., Order Date, Ship Date).


Relate each copy to the appropriate column in the fact table.


Use user-friendly names like OrderDateTable, ShipDateTable.


13. Handle Many-to-Many Between Customers and Products
If both tables are related via Sales:

Use the Sales table as a bridge.


Avoid direct many-to-many unless necessary.


If required, use composite models or bridge tables to manage relationships.


14. Use Bidirectional Filtering Sparingly â€“ When is it Appropriate?
âœ… Only when:

You need filters to flow both ways (e.g., slicers affecting lookup and fact tables).


You're modeling many-to-many relationships with intermediate tables.
âš  Overuse can cause performance issues or ambiguous relationships.
